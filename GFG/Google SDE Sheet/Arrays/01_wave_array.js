Question: 
Given an sorted array arr[] of integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place). In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5] ..... and so on. If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Note: The given array is sorted in ascending order, and modify the given array in-place without returning a new array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 2, 1, 4, 3, 5.
Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [4, 2, 8, 7, 10, 9]
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 4, 2, 8, 7, 10, 9.
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: [1]

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤109

class Solution {
    sortInWave(arr) {
        for(let i=0;i<arr.length-1;i+=2){
            [arr[i], arr[i+1]] = [arr[i+1], arr[i]];
        }
    }
}
